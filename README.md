# Fine_Tuned_Bertopic

## Introduction:

The following project is an example of how Bertopic can be tuned to optimize the process by understanding the fundamental aspects of its different components, achieving better results.

BERTopic is a topic modeling technique that leverages transformers and c-TF-IDF to create dense clusters allowing for easily interpretable topics whilst keeping important words in the topic descriptions. 

## Data:
The data used is the Womens Clothing E-Commerce Reviews dataset which includes reviews written by customers. It can be found in the following link:

## Requirements:

```pandas:``` Data analysis and manipulation tool.

```matplotlib:``` Visualization library.

```scikit-learn:``` Machine Learning library.

```NLTK:``` The Natural Language Toolkit is a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing (NLP). 

```Sentence Transformers:``` Python module for accessing, using, and training state-of-the-art text and image embedding models.

```UMAP:``` Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is a dimension reduction technique that can be used for visualisation similarly to t-SNE, but also for general non-linear dimension reduction. 

```hdbscan:``` Suite of tools to use unsupervised learning. The library provides a high performance implementation of the HDBSCAN algorithm, along with tools for analysing the resulting clustering.
